## Assignment Rundown

<p>This assignment is a continuation of Homework 2, which this assignment is based off of. We essentially wrote each record to a `.json` file and use each of those files to convert each record's details to an object. </p>

### To Run:
<p>After running, the program should output the relevant details in the terminal window. It will also create `.json` files in the program, but the `.json` records have been left in for convenience.<br>
To execute, run via the Makefile, through `hw3`.</p>

*Please adjust Makefile* `LDFLAGS` *for relevant operating system*
